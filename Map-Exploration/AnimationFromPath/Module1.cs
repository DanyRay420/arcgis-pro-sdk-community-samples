  /// This sample allows creation of animation from path. A couple of different
  /// options have been proovided including View Along, Top-Down, Face-Target etc.
  /// The add-in also allows for setting Z-Offset, Duration and Custom Pitch.
  /// The Set Target tool can be used to specify a target that the camera will always
  /// face in the created animation. Set-target tool is used with the Face-Target view mode.
  /// In addition to the view you would like, the add-in also provides three different
  /// options for creating the keyframes. You can choose to:
  /// - Keyframes along path - creates fewer keyframes but tries to keep you on the path 
  ///   while avoiding sharp turns at corners
  /// - Keyframes every N seconds - creates a keyframe at the time-spacing specified
  /// - Keyframes only at vertices - creates a keyframe at each line vertex
  /// </summary>

  /// 1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
  /// 1. Launch the debuuger to open ArcGIS Pro.
  /// 1. Open a scene or map view and a line feature class
  /// 1. Select a line feature
  /// 1. On the Add-In tab choose options under Animation from Path group and create keyframes
  /// Note: The selected line geometry is used for creating the keyframes. This means that
  ///  for a 2D line feature, the keyframes will be created at zero height + any Z-Offset you
  ///  specified in the options on the Add-In tab
