    /// This sample illustrates how to customize ArcGIS Pro's Layer Pop-up screen.  The sample shows how to define layer popups that will be persisted in the layer's CIM definition and defines a set of 'helper' classes modelled after the similar pattern ArcGIS.Desktop.Mapping implements for Renderer definitions. Popups can be defined that incorporate text, field values, images, charts, etc.
