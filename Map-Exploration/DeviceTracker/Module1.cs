  /// 1. If your device is not currently connected, the Current Properties section should be blank. 
  /// 1. Under "Input Parameters", enter the communicating comPort for your device. The comPort is the mandatory property required to connect. Other parameters such as baud rate, antenna height, accuracy are optional.  
  /// 1. Click the "Open" button. The "Current Parameters" should be populated and your device should be connected.
  /// 1. You can update your connection parameters (such as baud rate or antenna height) by entering values in the Input Properties and clicking the "Update" button.
