<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used. To use images in this section, create the image file in your sample project's screenshots folder. Use relative url to link to this image using this syntax: ![My sample Image](FacePage/SampleImage.png) -->
1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.  
1. This solution is using the **Extended.Wpf.Toolkit NuGet**.  If needed, you can install the NuGet from the "NuGet Package Manager Console" by using this script: "Install-Package Extended.Wpf.Toolkit".  
1. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro.  
1. ArcGIS Pro will open.   
1. Open a map view   
1. Click on ADD-IN tab and click the "Add Canvas" button in the "Scribble" group  
1. Scribble control will be added to the top of the map view  
1. By default, the control is the same width as the current map-view pane and the default height is just enough to show the toolbar  
1. Grab the handle at bottom-center of the control to expand the drawing/canvas area  
1. Now you should be able to draw with the pencil tool (left-mouse-down and drag)  
1. Shapes can be inserted by right-clicking in the canvas
