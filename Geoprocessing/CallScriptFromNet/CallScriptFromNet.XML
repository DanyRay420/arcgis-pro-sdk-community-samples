            This Button add-in, when clicked, calls a Python script, reads the text stream
            output from the script and uses it. From simplicity, output text is sent to windows messagebox.
            However, you can execute complex Python code in the Python script and call the script
            from within the button.

            1. Make sure there is a Python script under ..\CallScriptFromNet\CallScriptFromNet folder.
            2. Example script included in that folder is named test.py
            3. Build the solution - make sure it compiles successfully.
            4. Open ArcGIS Pro - go to ADD-IN Tab, find RunPyScriptButton in Group 1 group.
            5. Click on the button - wait few seconds - a message box will show up with a message of "Hello - this message is from a TEST Python script"
