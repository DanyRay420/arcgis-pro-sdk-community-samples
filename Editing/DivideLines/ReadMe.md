## How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used. To use images in this section, create the image file in your sample project's screenshots folder. Use relative url to link to this image using this syntax: ![My sample Image](FacePage/SampleImage.png) -->
This sample creates a map tool that is similar to other editing tools in the Modify Features pane, in that it opens a control within the pane with a dialog for user input. It follows the MVVM pattern used by the editing tools.
To use this sample:
  
1. Debug through Visual Studio or compile and run ArcGIS Pro.  
1. In Pro, add or create a map with lines.  
1. Select a single line in the map.  
1. Click the Divide Lines tool in the Divide group within the Modify Features pane.  
1. In the pane for Divide Lines, select the option and enter a value. Click on Divide.  

The selected line should be divided and the selection cleared. The tool remains active to enable selection of other lines to repeat the process.
