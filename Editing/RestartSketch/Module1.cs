    /// The main use case for this functionality is to start creating a new feature relative to somewhere else such as a distance and bearing from a road intersection or a distance along a stream.
    /// To use this add-in:
    /// 1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  The sample data contains a project called "FeatureTest.aprx" with data suitable for this sample.  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" is available.
    /// 1. Open this solution in Visual Studio.
    /// 1. Click the build menu and select Build Solution.
    /// 1. Launch the debugger to open ArCGIS Pro. ArcGIS Pro will open.  
    /// 1. Open the "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" project.
    /// 1. Create an edit sketch representing the offset from an origin. E.g. start the sketch at an intersection and digitize a segment with direction and distance constraints.
    /// 1. Start editing on the "TestLines" feature layer.  Place the first vertex by snapping to a given point and right click to chose a direction.
    /// ![UI](Screenshots/Screen1.png)
    /// 1. Right click to set a given distance.

    /// 1. Now I want to start my 'real' sketch at this vertex (with given direction and distance from a starting location).
    /// 1. Right click to display the sketch context menu and click 'Restart Sketch'.
