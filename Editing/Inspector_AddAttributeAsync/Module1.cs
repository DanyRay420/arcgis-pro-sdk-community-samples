{
  /// <summary>
  /// This sample demonstrates how to use the Inspector.AddAttributeAsync method. The sample contains a single map tool which displays a grid requesting attribute values
  /// from the user. After entering values into the grid, the user sketches a rectangle to identify features.  The attributes will be applied to the features that are 
  /// identified by the tool.
  /// 
  /// In this example we are using Inspector.AddAttributeAsync to only add a few fields from a single specific layer.  It is possible to add fields from multiple layers to 
  /// display in the grid. 
  /// </summary>
  /// 
  /// <remarks>
  /// 1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the 'Resources' section for downloading sample data)
  /// 1. Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in C:\Data
  /// 1. Before you run the sample verify that the project "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps\Interacting with Maps.aprx" is present since this is required to run the sample.
  /// 1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
  /// 1. Launch the debugger to open ArcGIS Pro.
  /// 1. ArcGIS Pro will open.
  /// 1. Open the "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps\Interacting with Maps" project.
  /// 1. Click on the Add-In tab.
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/ribbon.png)
  /// 1. Click on the "Apply Attrributes" button.
  /// 1. A dockpane will be displayed showing the fields requiring user input. In this example we have chosen 2 fields from the Police Stations layer. 
  /// Each field is shown as invalid (outlined in a red box) indicating that validation of the values has occurred.
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/ApplyAttributes_1.png)
  /// 1. Enter a value into the first field.  The value is validated. A valid value is outlined with a green box.  The user can hover over the side bar of any invalid value to see any message you wish to display.
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/ApplyAttributes_2.png)
  /// 1. Enter a value into the second field.  The value is validated.  
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/ApplyAttributes_3.png)
  /// 1. Now draw a rectangle on the map around one of more Police Station features. 
  /// 1. The values entered will be applied to the identified features.
