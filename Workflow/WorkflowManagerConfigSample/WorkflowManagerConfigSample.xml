            This sample allows users to only interact with the Workflow Pane in ArcGIS Pro, and hides the Workflow View, the Job view and the Workflow ribbon on map from the user. This configuration allows organizations to deploy a slimmed down version of Workflow Manager for ArcGIS Pro that focusses on work completion.
